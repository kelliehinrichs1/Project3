    <h2>Why I decided to take a Web Development Class</h2>
    <p>I decided to take web development because I was interested
      in how to create my own webpage. I wanted to learn other
      programming languages that will most definitely benefit my
      future as a Computer Science major. This course so far has
      been very enjoyable and am excited to learn what's next.</p>
